# One-Offs
A collection of the smaller one-off projects I've worked on over the years.  Some are in varying states of completion.

## [Calculator](Calculator.py)
A simple calculator GUI with the ability to evaluate basic math equations.  Made to see if I could create a semi-useful app with TKinter.

## [Endless Tic-Tac-Toe](Endless%20Tic-Tac-Toe.py)
A work-in-progress Tic-Tac-Toe game where the oldest move is undone after a few turns.  Still needs most of the logic and all of the GUI code written.

## [Image Converter](Image%20Converter.py)
An old, unfinished project that converts images from one type to another.  Made before I knew how to effectively use comments and organize code.

## [Number Generator](number_generator.py)
A simple script that generates random numbers.  Made as an excersize on parsing command-line arguments and working with a progress bar.

## [WebM to MP4](WebM%20to%20MP4.py)
An unfinished GUI port of an old script that I lost.  Does exactly what it says on the tin.  All individual parts of the script work, they just need to work *together*.
